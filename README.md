This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Sorting Visualizer

This is a web app built using React and is used to enhance the proceess of studying sortng algorithms for students by visualizing sorting algorithms step-by-step on unsorted arrays. Includes sorting algorithms such as merge sort, bubble sort, insertion sort and etc. Speed of algorithm's visualization and size of unsorted arrays can be adjusted which provides different options for studying purposes. 

App is deployed and can be accessed here: https://bazuevad.github.io/sorting-algos/.

## Purpose 

I wanted to learn React as well as revise classic sorting algorithms for my interview prep. This app turned out to be the great way to achieve both objectives at once. It is a great tool to visualize the step-by-step process of performing sorting algorithms on unsorted list of values. You can generate new array and then perform any of sorting algorithms on it.

## Installation 

If you wish to run this app locally, clone this repo and install the dependencies.

$ git clone https://github.com/bazuevad/sorting-algos.git
$ cd sort-visualizer
$ npm install

## App Conventions

The src folder contains three subdirectories:




### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
